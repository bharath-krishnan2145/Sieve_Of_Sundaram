Sieve of Sundaram - Prime Number Generator
This is a Java implementation of the Sieve of Sundaram algorithm, an efficient method for generating prime numbers up to a given limit.

🚀 Features
Generates prime numbers efficiently.
Uses a boolean array to optimize performance.
Simple command-line input for user interaction.

🛠 How It Works
The Sieve of Sundaram eliminates numbers of the form:
                i+j+2ij≤N
from consideration, leaving only prime numbers in the modified range.

📌 Usage
1. Compile the Java Program
    javac SieveOfSundaram.java
2. Run the Program
    java SieveOfSundaram
3. Example Output
    Enter the value of n: 30
    Prime numbers up to 30: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29

🖥 Technologies Used
